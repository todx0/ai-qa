# AI QA
This is a demo project showcasing how a few lines of code can save a significant amount of money by replacing the need to hire trainee/junior QA members. With the power of ✨AI✨, you can avoid costs like salary, life insurance, and employee taxes.

## Why Gherkin Syntax?

While I’m personally not a fan of Gherkin syntax, it’s used in this demo for a few key reasons:

- Easily AI-Generated: Gherkin syntax is simple to generate, and AI understands it well.
- Sucks the Fun Out of QA: Just like AI, Gherkin takes the joy out of QA work—making them a perfect match.
    
## The Downsides
Test results may be flaky and debugging experience is painful comparing to regular automation tests.
